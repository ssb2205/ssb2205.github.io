        <div class="text-block-2 pad-vertical pad-horizontal"> We are re-imagining sexual health care.</div>
        <div class="text-block-4 pad-horizontal"><i>deSTIgma</i> was founded in 2022 by a group of friends who saw and experienced how the stigma against STIs was causing them and their peers to forego necessary medical attention. We found disheartening data that STIs were still highly prevalent in the U.S., affecting millions of young adults such as ourselves. We proposed the <i>deSTIgma</i> digital platform as a way to reach the greatest number of people and provide them with the knowledge and resources necessary to make informed decisions about their sexual health and wellness. We present <i>deSTIgma</i> as a modern tool that streamlines the STI-care seeking process, making it easier for people to find the care they need without feeling afraid or embarrassed for themselves. </div>
        <div class="text-block-4 pad-vertical pad-horizontal"> The <i>deSTIgma</i> team is made up of several multi-faceted individuals, with expertise in app development, professional communication, data analytics, and more. Two core team members are members of the Sia Lab, known for its HIV diagnostic technology and global-scale commercialization. Others have conducted extensive research in the Azizi Lab and the Zuckerman Institute at Columbia University, which specialize in computational cancer biology and theoretical neuroscience, respectively. Through our research at Columbia, we are closely connected with a network of faculty, physicians, and staff who have and will continue to provide advising and mentorship throughout our growth and development. Thus, <i>deSTIgma</i> is well positioned to bring our solution to the public. </div>
